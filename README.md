2. promoting cultural events

### How will our website stand out?

2. we will post the most interesting events

### How we want our website to look like?
- for each event we would like to individually choose the style and graphics
- plenty of various photos
- we will share useful information - such as how to get to the event location, or where to purchase tickets
